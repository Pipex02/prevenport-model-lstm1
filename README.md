# Prevenport Component X – LSTM Classifier

This repo contains an LSTM-based classification project for the SCANIA Component X predictive maintenance dataset.

Main goal: train a PyTorch LSTM model that classifies per-vehicle time-series sequences into the 5 proximity-to-failure classes defined in the dataset.

Start with the detailed project plan in `docs/component-x-lstm-plan.md` for the full roadmap (phases 0–11).
